description: Overview of programming languages supported by E2B Sandbox for running AI-generated code.

Typically you use Python to run AI-generated code for data analysis but you can use other languages as well.

Out of the box E2B Sandbox supports:
- [Python](/docs/code-interpreting/supported-languages/python)
- [JavaScript](/docs/code-interpreting/supported-languages/javascript)
- [R](/docs/code-interpreting/supported-languages/r)
- [Java](/docs/code-interpreting/supported-languages/java)
- [Bash](/docs/code-interpreting/supported-languages/bash)

You can use any custom language runtime by creating a [custom sandbox template](/docs/sandbox-template).
